Frontend Mentor Challenge - Grid Blocks

Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Create the design by using grid CSS for the placing of the main cards
and Flex-Box for positioning of the items inside the cards.

Add the icons with FontAwesome.
